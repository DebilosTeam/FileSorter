  <h2 align="center">A small utility that sorts your files.</h2>
</p>

### TODO:
- [x] Scan directory to find files(thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [x] Split extensions to determine file type(also thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [x] Move files(and here also thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [ ] Add more file extensions (probably will never be checked because there is a LOT of extensions)
- [x] Create directories(Music, Photos, Videos etc.) if they not existing,otherwise, if directories exist, create directories with suffix "_moved"

### How to use this utility?
Just drop the main.py and config.json in the folder that need to be sorted and run the script

P.S. Probably I`ll make something like package or executable idk, if i don't be lazy.

### How can I help?
Feel free to fork this repo and make a pull request or create an issue, if you encountered an problem!
