# FileSorter
A small utility that sorts your files.
# TODO:
- [x] Scan directory to find files(thanks @corruptmemry for this!)
- [x] Split extensions to determine file type(also thanks @corruptmemry for this!)
- [x] Move files(and here also thanks @corruptmemry for this!)
- [ ] Add more file extensions (probably will never be checked because there are a LOT of extensions)
- [x] Create directories(Music,Photos,Videos etc.) if they not existing,otherwise, if directories exist, create directories with suffix "_moved"
# How to use this utility?
Just drop the main.py and config.json in the folder that need to be sorted and run the script

P.S. Probably I`ll make something like package or executable idk, if i don't be lazy.
# How can I help?
